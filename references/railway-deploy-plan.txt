Looking at the error message and file structure you've provided, I see the issue with your Railway deployment. The error says `/opt/venv/bin/python: No module named rdagent.__main__; 'rdagent' is a package and cannot be directly executed`.

Let me help you set up RD-Agent on Railway for your CSV marketing KPI analysis use case:

1. **Fix the Deployment Issue**

   Create a new file in your repository called `main.py` at the root level with the following content:

```python
from rdagent.app.cli import app

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app()
```

2. **Configure Railway Environment**

   In your Railway project settings, you need to set the following environment variables:
   
   - `OPENAI_API_KEY` - Your OpenAI API key
   - `CHAT_MODEL` - Set to "gpt-4-turbo" (or your preferred model)
   - `PORT` - Set to 3000
   - `KG_LOCAL_DATA_PATH` - Set to "/app/data"
   
3. **Update Your Dockerfile or Project Settings**

   Create or modify your Dockerfile with:

```dockerfile
FROM python:3.10-slim

WORKDIR /app

COPY . .

RUN pip install -e .

CMD ["python", "main.py", "kaggle", "--competition", "your-competition-id"]
```

   Alternatively, in your Railway project settings, set the start command to:
   `python main.py kaggle --competition your-competition-id`

4. **Prepare Your CSV Data**

   In your repository, create a `data` directory and add a directory structure like:
   
   ```
   data/
   ├── your-competition-id/
   │   └── your-marketing-kpi.csv
   └── your-competition-id.json
   ```
   
   Create a simple JSON configuration file for your marketing KPI data:
   
```json
{
  "title": "Marketing KPI Analysis",
  "description": "Analysis of marketing performance indicators across campaigns",
  "evaluation_metric": "accuracy",
  "task_type": "classification"
}
```

5. **Deploy to Railway**

   - Push these changes to your GitHub repository
   - Connect your Railway project to your repository
   - Deploy the application

This approach will get RD-Agent running on Railway with your marketing KPI data. Once deployed, you'll be able to access the web interface to analyze your data and visualize results.

Would you like me to explain how to structure your marketing CSV data for optimal analysis, or help with any specific part of this setup?
